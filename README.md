# Notes

- The project uses MVVM with RxSwift and avoiding Storyboards.
- I wrote all the "frontend" messages/labels in spanish language because the api give me feedback in spanish, if not it will be a bit weird.
- About Testing, i tried to test unless one file from each layer: 1 View Controller, 1, 1 View Model, 1 Data Resource
- I wrote some TODO's as possible improvements, but did not implement them.
- About the design, it can be better of course, i centered all my effort on the architecture and code.
